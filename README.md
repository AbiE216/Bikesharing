## Overview 
### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to decide the best way to bring Citibike to Des Moines, Iowa. This was done by filtering through the data of New York City. 

## Results

This image displays the average check out time, then it compares it across genders. The primary conclusion here, is that males are by far the most common rider. Which coule mean a few things, 1. The advertising is more geared towards women or 2. The bikes are more suited to male anatomy than female. If the first conclusion is correct, then advertising should continue as is, but more ads should be geared towards women, afterall more riders are better for business. If the second conclusion is correct, it is not too difficult to gear the seats to women, and perhaps dividing the number , or finding a seat that works for both.
What would be an interesting comparison is the most popular start and stop locations based on gender, this would allow them to place bikes accordingly to have the most impact.

This combination of heat maps is a lovely demonstration of the most popular times of day, per day of the week, further is divides that between genders, separately it divides them by whether or not they have a subscription. The information here, is to be sure that the most bikes are available at 8am and 5 or 6pm in the evenings. before midnight to 5am is the best way time to provide maintenance for the bikes. In regards to whether or not someone is a subscriber shows that they are the dominant users especially on Thursdays. It would be beneficial then to make the first month free if they join as subscribers, they might cancel after a month, but if they are please with the services, they might tell others, who would pay for a subscription.

The final set of maps, deals with the the starting and ending locations of the bikes. As per the discussion of the first image, this particular graph tells us where the best place to put bikes are, the more bikes in a high use area, the more customers can be served. By breaking it down further, it could allow us to target by gender or user type. 
## Summary 
In addition to what's been laid out, it would likely be beneficial to examine time of day usage with location, knowing what time of day and where to have bikes allows more customers to be served as well as creating a clean rotation of bikes so that they aren't overused or underserviced. These both save money and generate revenue.
